Task 1: Predicting Aggregate Ratings Objective: Predict restaurant aggregate ratings based on features like Cuisines and Locality using regression models. Steps: Data Loading and Preprocessing: Load the dataset (Dataset.csv), clean it by removing missing values. Encoding Categorical Variables: Use One-Hot Encoding for categorical features (Cuisines, Locality). Splitting Data: Divide data into training and testing sets. Training and Evaluating Models: Linear Regression: Train and evaluate using MSE and R-squared. Decision Tree Regressor: Train and evaluate using MSE and R-squared. Visualizing Predictions: Compare model predictions using plots. Requirements: pandas scikit-learn matplotlib Installation: pip install pandas scikit-learn matplotlib Execution: Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repository.git Navigate to the project directory: cd your-repository Place Dataset.csv in the specified directory. Run the script to process, train, and visualize.

Task 2: Restaurant Recommendation System Objective: Develop a recommendation system based on user preferences for cuisine and price range, and evaluate its performance. Steps: Data Loading and Preprocessing: Load the dataset (Dataset.csv), handle missing values. Feature Encoding: Encode features like Cuisines and Price range using Label Encoding. Recommendation System: Implement a function to recommend restaurants. Performance Evaluation: Calculate precision, recall, and F1-score. Visualize these metrics. Requirements: pandas scikit-learn matplotlib Installation: pip install pandas scikit-learn matplotlib Execution: Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repository.git Navigate to the project directory: cd your-repository Place Dataset.csv in the specified directory. Run the script to generate recommendations and evaluate performance.

Task 3: Restaurant Cuisine Classification Objective: Classify restaurants into different cuisine categories using machine learning models. Steps: Data Loading and Preprocessing: Load and clean the dataset (Dataset.csv), remove irrelevant features. Feature Encoding and Scaling: Use Label Encoding for categorical features and StandardScaler for numerical features. Model Training: Train Random Forest and Logistic Regression models. Model Evaluation: Assess models using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Requirements: pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn Installation: pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn Execution: Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repository.git Navigate to the project directory: cd your-repository Place Dataset.csv in the specified directory. Run the script to preprocess, train, and evaluate models.

Results for Each Task: Task 1: Performance metrics (MSE, R-squared) and visual comparisons of model predictions. Task 2: Recommended restaurants and performance metrics (precision, recall, F1-score). Task 3: Model performance metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score) and predictions by the Logistic Regression model.
